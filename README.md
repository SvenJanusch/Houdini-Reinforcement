   		<td style="vertical-align: top;">The Hair Card Houdini project is a procedural tool designed to generate hair and fur images, similar to the commercial software [FiberShop](https://cgpal.com/fibershop/). It allows real-time control over various attributes of the fibers, such as shape, color, distribution and more. The hair card can be previewed within Houdini or exported as images. Supported image types include Albedo, Alpha, Root-Tip, Random / Specular, Depth, Normal, Tangent / Direction, Fiber ID and Ambient Occlusion. A detailed description, tutorials and results are available on my [blog](https://svenjanusch.wordpress.com/2023/10/22/hair-card/)
